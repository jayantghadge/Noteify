# Noteify

Noteify is a notes web application built using React and Tailwind CSS. It offers a fast and efficient way to create, search, delete and download notes, with a clean and minimalistic user interface.
Noteify utilizes local storage to automatically save notes, ensuring that user data is never lost even when exiting or refreshing the browser.
